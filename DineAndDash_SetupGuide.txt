How to Set Up WebStorm for the Project

Prerequisites:
1. Git: Make sure Git is installed on your machine.
2. Node.js and npm: You need Node.js to run npm commands. npm comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js will automatically install npm as well.

Steps:
1. Install Git (if not already installed):
   - Download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/
   - Follow the installation instructions for your platform.

2. Install Node.js (if not already installed):
   - Download the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
   - Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system. 
   - After installation, you can verify if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
     node -v
     npm -v

3. Clone the repository:
   - Create a new folder on your computer where you'd like to work on the project.
   - Open a terminal in that folder and run:
     git clone https://github.com/Ryyan-Choudhary/DineAndDash_FoodDelivery.git

4. Open the project in WebStorm:
   - Open WebStorm and select Open to open the cloned DineAndDash_FoodDelivery folder.
   - WebStorm will automatically detect and set up the project for you.

5. Install the dependencies for the frontend and backend:
   - Open a terminal in WebStorm (or use your command prompt) and navigate to the frontend and backend directories.

   For the frontend:
     cd frontend
     npm install

   For the backend:
     cd ../backend
     npm install

6. Create the .env file in the backend:
   - In the `backend` folder, create a new file named `.env`
   - Add the following variables inside it (example values shown):

     DB_USER=your_username  
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password  
     DB_NAME=DineAndDash  
     DB_SERVER=localhost  
     DB_PORT=1433  

   - Make sure these values match your Microsoft SQL Server setup.

7. Verify SQL Server TCP and Port Settings:
   - Open SQL Server Configuration Manager.
   - Navigate to: SQL Server Network Configuration > Protocols for MSSQLSERVER
   - Ensure TCP/IP is **Enabled**.
   - Right-click TCP/IP > Properties > IP Addresses tab:
     - Scroll to the bottom and check the TCP Port (usually `1433`).
   - Restart SQL Server service if you made changes.

8. Enable SQL Server Authentication and Set Admin Login:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Right-click the server name in Object Explorer > Properties.
   - Under "Security", ensure "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode" is selected.
   - Click OK, and **restart** the SQL Server.

   - To enable the `sa` account (if disabled):
     - In Object Explorer, go to Security > Logins.
     - Right-click on `sa` > Properties.
     - Set a password and make sure the account is **enabled**.
     - Click OK.

   - To change the `sa` password:
     - Right-click on `sa` > Properties > General.
     - Enter and confirm a new password.
     - Click OK.

9. Start the backend and frontend:
   - Once the dependencies are installed and `.env` is set, you can start the servers:

   For the frontend:
     cd frontend
     npm start

   For the backend:
     cd backend
     npm start
