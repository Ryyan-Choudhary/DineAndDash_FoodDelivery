How to Set Up WebStorm for the Project

Prerequisites:
1. Git: Make sure Git is installed on your machine.
2. Node.js and npm: You need Node.js to run npm commands. npm comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js will automatically install npm as well.

Steps:
1. Install Git (if not already installed):
   - Download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/
   - Follow the installation instructions for your platform.

2. Install Node.js (if not already installed):
   - Download the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.
   - Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system. 
   - After installation, you can verify if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
     node -v
     npm -v

3. Clone the repository:
   - Create a new folder on your computer where you'd like to work on the project.
   - Open a terminal in that folder and run:
     git clone https://github.com/Ryyan-Choudhary/DineAndDash_FoodDelivery.git

4. Open the project in WebStorm:
   - Open WebStorm and select Open to open the cloned DineAndDash_FoodDelivery folder.
   - WebStorm will automatically detect and set up the project for you.

5. Install the dependencies for the frontend and backend:
   - Open a terminal in WebStorm (or use your command prompt) and navigate to the frontend and backend directories.

   For the frontend:
     cd frontend
     npm install

   For the backend:
     cd ../backend
     npm install

6. Start the backend and frontend:
   - Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the backend and frontend servers.

   For the frontend:
     cd frontend
     npm start

   For the backend:
     cd backend
     npm start
